# Chatting
The system is to create a "chat" application, using the client/server architectural model. The chat system consists of two main distributed components: chat server and chat client, which may run on different hosts in the network. Chat clients are Java programs which can connect to a chat server.
The chat server is a Java application which can accept multiple incoming TCP connections. The chat server maintains a list of current chat rooms and chat clients can move between chat rooms. Messages sent by a chat client are broadcast to all clients currently connected to the same chat room.
